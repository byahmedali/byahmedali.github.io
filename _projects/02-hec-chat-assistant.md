### ðŸ“Š Project Overview
HEC Chat Assistant is a Generative AI-powered chatbot designed to provide accurate and timely information about the services, policies, and programs of Pakistan's Higher Education Commission (HEC). Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, it ensures highly relevant and context-aware responses. The solution integrates advanced technologies, including `nomic-embed-text` for embedding creation, Metaâ€™s `llama-3-70b` for natural language generation, and `chromadb` as vector store. This seamless workflow transforms knowledge base data into vector embeddings, enabling rapid retrieval and precise, context-aware responses to the end-user.

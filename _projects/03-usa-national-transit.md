### Project Overview ðŸ“Š
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built from the [National Transit Dataset (NTD)](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd), a comprehensive data source from the U.S. Federal Transit Administration (FTA). It tracks monthly ridership trends, vehicle revenue miles, and performance metrics across various public transit systems. The goal is to provide stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers with data-driven insights on regional usage patterns, the impact of events like COVID-19, and mode-specific operational performance.

### Tools & Technologies ðŸ› 
- **Microsoft Power BI** â€“ For interactive dashboard design and data visualization.
- **Azure Databricks** â€“ Used for large-scale data preprocessing and transformation.
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Employed for supplemental data cleanup and integration.

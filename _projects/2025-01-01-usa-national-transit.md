## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built from the **National Transit Dataset (NTD)**, a comprehensive data source from the U.S. Federal Transit Administration (FTA). It tracks **monthly ridership trends**, **vehicle revenue miles**, and **performance metrics** across various public transit systems.

The goal is to provide stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers with data-driven insights on **regional usage patterns**, the **impact of events like COVID-19**, and **mode-specific operational performance**.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Power BI** – For interactive dashboard design and data visualization.
- **Azure Databricks** – Used for large-scale data preprocessing and transformation.
- **Microsoft Excel** – Employed for supplemental data cleanup and integration.
- **OData Feed & NTD APIs** – For ingesting and refreshing live transit datasets.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📈 **Visualize Monthly Ridership**: Interactive charts of passenger trips by region and mode.
- 🧭 **Regional Usage Patterns**: Comparative metrics across U.S. states and cities.
- 🦠 **COVID-19 Impact Analysis**: Significant drop visualized during pandemic years.
- 🚍 **Transit Modes Breakdown**: Includes buses, rail, paratransit, and ferry systems.
- 📍 **Map-Based Insights**: Explore usage intensity through geographic visuals.

## 💡 Insights

- A dramatic ridership drop occurred in March 2020, correlating with pandemic shutdowns.
- Some transit modes, like demand-response services, were less impacted than others.
- Ridership recovery patterns vary regionally, with urban centers lagging behind.

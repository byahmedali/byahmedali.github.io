### Project Overview üêç  
**This Python script automates the process of extracting result scores from ETEA‚Äôs official website using Selenium.**  

After appearing in a Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency (ETEA) test, I wanted to know where I stood in comparison to other candidates. In technical terms, I was looking for my percentile score but manually checking nearly 900 roll numbers was out of the question.  

Being a beginner in Python at the time, I took this as a real-world challenge and turned to automation. After exploring various libraries, `Selenium` stood out. I quickly learned its basics, followed documentation and through several iterations of testing and debugging, I successfully built a script to extract marks data efficiently.

### Story Behind the Code üí°  
This project was more than a script. It was my first hands-on success with using code to solve a personal, real-world problem. It showed me how powerful programming can be when driven by a clear goal. What started as curiosity quickly became a productive learning experience.

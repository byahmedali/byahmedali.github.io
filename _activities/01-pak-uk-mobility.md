### Overview üåç  
As part of the **PAK-UK Education Gateway Mobility Partnership for Students**, I was selected as a research student representative from PAF-IAST under a prestigious grant awarded by the British Council and the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. This opportunity took me to **Coventry, United Kingdom**, in **August 2023**, where I collaborated with leading researchers and professionals in **Artificial Intelligence and Robotics**.

During my time there, I:
- Attended specialized training seminars and workshops
- Participated in poster presentations and showcased my research
- Visited various cutting-edge research centers and labs

This academic and cultural exchange significantly strengthened my research skills, cross-cultural communication, and professional network.

## ðŸ§  Abstract

Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are common and often debilitating health issues that affect a significant portion of the population. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision algorithms, have shown great potential in detecting and classifying medical images. These algorithms utilize deep convolutional neural network architectures to learn complex spatial features in images and make predictions for similar unseen images.

The proposed study aims to assist gastroenterologists in making more efficient and accurate diagnoses of GI patients by utilizing its **two-phase transfer learning framework** to identify GI diseases from endoscopic images. Three pre-trained image classification models â€” **Xception**, **InceptionResNetV2**, and **VGG16** â€” are fine-tuned on publicly available datasets of annotated endoscopic images of the GI tract. Additionally, two custom convolutional neural networks are constructed and fully trained for comparative analysis.

Four classification tasks are explored:

- âœ… **Eight-category classification** (general GI tract): *85.7% accuracy*  
- âœ… **Three-disease classification**: *97.6% accuracy*  
- âœ… **Polyp identification (binary)**: *99.5% accuracy*  
- âœ… **Esophagitis severity classification (binary)**: *74.2% accuracy*

The architecture based on **InceptionResNetV2** shows the most generalized and consistent performance across tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of the framework for clinical use, enhancing early diagnosis and treatment planning.
